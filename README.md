# Cobalt
An analytics pipeline with built-in user-privacy.

[TOC]

## Purpose of this document
You may encounter this document in one of two scenarios:

* Because you are working with the stand-alone Cobalt repo found at
`https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/cobalt`, or
* because you are working with a checkout of the Fuchsia operating system
in which Cobalt has been imported into `//third_party/cobalt.`

This document should be used only in the first context. It describes how to
build and test Cobalt independently of Fuchsia. Stand-alone Cobalt
includes server-side components that run in Linux on Google Kubernetes Engine
and a generic client library that is compiled for Linux using the build
described in this document..

When imported into `//third_party/cobalt` within a Fuchsia checkout, the Cobalt
client library is compiled for Fuchsia and accessed via a FIDL wrapper. If you
are trying to use Cobalt from an application running on Fuchsia, stop reading
this document and instead read Cobalt's
[README.md](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/src/cobalt/bin/README.md)
in the Fuchsia repo.

## Requirements
  1. We only develop on Linux. You may or may not have success on other
  systems.
  2. Python 2.7
  3. libstdc++
On a new Linux glaptop you may not have libstdc++ installed. A command similar
to the following appears to work:
`sudo apt-get install libstdc++-8-dev`

## Fetch the code
For example via
* `git clone https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/cobalt`
* `cd cobalt`

## Run setup
 `./cobaltb.py setup`. This will take a few minutes the first time. It does
 the following:
  * Fetches third party code into the `third_party` dir via git submodules.
  * Fetches the sysroot and puts it in the `sysroot` dir. This uses a tool
  called `cipd` or *Chrome Infrastructure Package Deployer*.
  * Other miscellaneous stuff

## cobaltb.py
The Python script cobaltb.py in the root directory is used to orchestrate
building, testing and deploying to Google Kubernetes Engine. It was already
used above in `./cobaltb.py setup`.

* `./cobaltb.py -h` for general help
* `cobaltb.py <command> -h` for help on a command
* `cobaltb.py <command> <subcommand> -h` for help on a sub-command

### The --verbose flag
If you pass the flag `--verbose` to various `cobaltb.py` commands you will see
more verbose output. Pass it multiple times to increase the verbosity
further.

## Build
  * `./cobaltb.py clean`
  * `./cobaltb.py build`

The Cobalt build uses GN and ninja.

## Linting
  * `./cobaltb.py lint`

See: [clang-tidy](docs/clang-tidy.md) for an explanation of clang-tidy configuration options.

## Run the Tests
  * `./cobaltb.py test` This runs the whole suite of tests finally running the
  the end-to-end test. The tests should all pass.
  * It is possible to run subsets of the tests by passing the `--tests=`
  argument.
  * See `./cobaltb.py test -h` for documentation about the `--tests=` argument.

## Contributing
Cobalt uses the Gerrit code review tool. See the
[submitting-changes](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/docs/+/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-changes)
section of the Fuchsia contributing doc for more info about using Gerrit.
But note that the stand-alone Cobalt build currently does not use Jiri.
Use the command `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master`. Also the other sections
of that document are not relevant to stand-alone Cobalt.

## Source Layout
The source layout is related to Cobalt's process architecture. Here we
describe the source layout and process architecture together. Most of
Cobalt's code is C++. The Shuffler is written in Go.

### The root directory
The most interesting contents of the root directory are the .proto files
`observation.proto`, which contains the definitions of *Observation* and
*Envelope*, and `encrypted_message.proto`, which contains the definition
of *EncryptedMessage.* Observations are the basic units of data captured by
a Cobalt client application. Each Observation is encrypted and the bytes are
stored in an *EncryptedMessage.* Multiple EncryptedMessages are stored in an
*ObservationBatch*. Multiple ObservationBatches are stored in an Envelope.
Envelopes are sent via HTTP from the *Encoder* to the *Shuffler*.

### build
This directory contains GN files needed for building Cobalt. Most of these files
should be similar if not identical to the associated file in the Fuchsia
repository [here](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/build).

### keys
This directory contains development keys for encrypting observations/envelopes
to the backend.

### manifest
This directory contains a Jiri manifest. It is used to integrate Cobalt into
the rest of the Fuchsia build when Cobalt is imported into third_party/cobalt.
This is not used at all in Cobalt's stand-alone build.

### meta
This directory contains cmx files for running Cobalt's tests in fuchsia.

### src
This directory is the root directory of the Cobalt source code. All new code
should be put in a subdirectory of src/

### src/algorithms
This directory contains the implementations of Cobalt's privacy-
preserving algorithms. This code is linked into both the Encoder, which
uses it to encode Observations, and the ReportMaster, which uses it to
decode Observations.

### src/system_data
This directory contains the code for Cobalt's Encoder, which is a
client library whose job is to encode Observations using one of several
privacy-preserving encodings, and send Envelopes to the Shuffler using HTTP.

### src/logger
This directory contains the code for Cobalt 1.0's Logger, which is a client
library whose job is to encode Observation2s using one of several
privacy-preserving encodings, and send Envelopes to the shuffler.

### src/test_app2
This directory contains the code for a linux test client for cobalt.

### src/registry
This directory contains the implementation of Cobalt's config registration
system. A client that wants to use Cobalt starts by registering configurations
of their *Metrics*, *Encodings* and *Reports*.

### tools
This directory contains build, test and deployment tooling.

### util
This directory contains utility libraries used by the Encoder and Analyzer.
